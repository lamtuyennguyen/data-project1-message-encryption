Project Description

With this code, messages can be encrypted for more security while sending. The sent code can be decrypted for the receivers to read.


Workflow

I created a dictionary to assign characters to their numbers to be encrypted with. Then 2 functions are created to look up in the dictionary for the relevant characters or the numbers respectively to be translated.


Organization

The repository has the file containing the encryption and decryption code, a README file and a gitignore.
